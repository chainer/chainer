# POS-tagging

This is an example of a POS-tagging problem for natural language processing.
Part of speech (POS) is a category of word, such as noun and verb.
POS-tagging problem is the task of assigning part of speech to each word in a sentence.
This problem can be formulated as a sequential labeling problem.
So, you can apply this example to another problems such as named entity recognition.

This example uses traditional linear-chain CRF model.
And of course you can extends this model with RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM and CNN.

You need to install nltk (https://www.nltk.org/) to execute the example.
