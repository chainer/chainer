# Reinforcement Learning Examples

These are minimal examples of writing reinforcement learning agents. You need to install [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) before running the examples.

- `dqn_cartpole.py` implements DQN and DoubleDQN and supports discrete-action tasks.
- `ddpg_pendulum.py` implements DDPG and supports continuous-action tasks.
