Chainer -- A flexible framework of neural networks
==================================================

`Chainer <https://chainer.org>`_ is a powerful, flexible and intuitive deep learning framework.

* Chainer supports CUDA computation. It only requires a few lines of code to leverage a GPU. It also runs on multiple GPUs with little effort.
* Chainer supports various network architectures including feed-forward nets, convnets, recurrent nets and recursive nets. It also supports per-batch architectures.
* Forward computation can include any control flow statements of Python without lacking the ability of backpropagation. It makes code intuitive and easy to debug.
