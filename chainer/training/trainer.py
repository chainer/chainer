class Trainer(object):

    """The standard training loop in Chainer.

    Trainer is an implementation of a training loop. Users can invoke the
    training by calling the :meth:`run` method.

    Each iteration of the training loop proceeds as follows.

    - Update of the parameters. It includes the mini-batch loading, forward
      and backward computations, and an execution of the update formula.
      These are all done by the update object held by the trainer.
    - Invocation of trainer extensions in the descending order of their
      priorities. A trigger object is attached to each extension, and it
      decides at each iteration whether the extension should be executed.
      Trigger objects are callable objects that take the trainer object as the
      argument and return a boolean value indicating whether the extension
      should be called or not.

    Extensions are callable objects that take the trainer object as the
    argument. There are three ways to define custom extensions: inheriting the
    :class:`Extension` class, decorating functions by :func:`make_extension`,
    and defining any callable including lambda functions. See
    :class:`Extension` for more details on custom extensions and how to
    configure them.

    Users can register extensions to the trainer by calling the :meth:`extend`
    method, where some configurations can be added.

    - Trigger object, which is also explained above. In most cases,
      :class:`IntervalTrigger` is used, in which case users can simply specify
      a tuple of the interval length and its unit, like
      ``(1000, 'iteration')`` or ``(1, 'epoch')``.
    - The order of execution of extensions is determined by their priorities.
      Extensions of higher priorities are invoked earlier. There are three
      standard values for the priorities:

      - ``PRIORITY_WRITER``. This is the priority for extensions that write
        some records to the :attr:`observation` dictionary. It includes cases
        that the extension directly adds values to the observation dictionary,
        or the extension uses the :func:`chainer.report` function to report
        values to the observation dictionary.
      - ``PRIORITY_EDITOR``. This is the priority for extensions that edit the
        :attr:`observation` dictionary based on already reported values.
      - ``PRIORITY_READER``. This is the priority for extensions that only read
        records from the :attr:`observation` dictionary. This is also suitable
        for extensions that do not use the :attr:`observation` dictionary at
        all.

    The current state of the trainer object and objects handled by the trainer
    can be serialized through the standard serialization protocol of Chainer.
    It enables us to easily suspend and resume the training loop.

    .. note::
       The serialization does not recover everything of the training loop. It
       only recovers the states which change over the training (e.g.
       parameters, optimizer states, the batch iterator state, extension
       states, etc.). You must initialize the objects correctly before
       deserializing the states.

       On the other hand, it means that users can change the settings on
       deserialization. For example, the exit condition can be changed on the
       deserialization, so users can train the model for some iterations,
       suspend it, and then resume it with larger number of total iterations.

    During the training, it also creates a :class:`~chainer.Reporter` object to
    store observed values on each update. For each iteration, it creates a
    fresh observation dictionary and stores it in the :attr:`observation`
    attribute.

    Links of the target model of each optimizer are registered to the reporter
    object as observers, where the name of each observer is constructed as the
    format ``<optimizer name><link name>``. The link name is given by the
    :meth:`chainer.Link.namedlink` method, which represents the path to each
    link in the hierarchy. Other observers can be registered by accessing the
    reporter object via the :attr:`reporter` attribute.

    The default trainer is `plain`, i.e., it does not contain any extensions.

    Args:
        updater (~chainer.training.Updater): Updater object. It defines how to
            update the models.
        stop_trigger: Trigger that determines when to stop the training loop.
            If it is not callable, it is passed to :class:`IntervalTrigger`.

    Attributes:
        updater: The updater object for this trainer.
        stop_trigger: Trigger that determines when to stop the training loop.
            The training loop stops at the iteration on which this trigger
            returns ``True``.
        observation: Observation of values made at the last update. See the
            :class:`Reporter` class for details.
