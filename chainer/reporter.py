class Reporter(object):

    """Object to which observed values are reported.

    Reporter is used to collect values that users want to watch. The reporter
    object holds a mapping from value names to the actually observed values.
    We call this mapping `observations`.

    When a value is passed to the reporter, an object called `observer` can be
    optionally attached. In this case, the name of the observer is added as the
    prefix of the value name. The observer name should be registered
    beforehand.

    See the following example::

       >>> from chainer import Reporter, report, report_scope
       >>>
       >>> reporter = Reporter()
       >>> observer = object()  # it can be an arbitrary (reference) object
       >>> reporter.add_observer('my_observer:', observer)
       >>> observation = {}
       >>> with reporter.scope(observation):
       ...     reporter.report({'x': 1}, observer)
       ...
       >>> observation
       {'my_observer:x': 1}

    There are also a global API to add values::

       >>> observation = {}
       >>> with report_scope(observation):
       ...     report({'x': 1}, observer)
       ...
       >>> observation
       {'my_observer:x': 1}

    The most important application of Reporter is to report observed values
    from each link or chain in the training and validation procedures.
    :class:`~chainer.training.Trainer` and some extensions prepare their own
    Reporter object with the hierarchy of the target link registered as
    observers. We can use :func:`report` function inside any links and chains
    to report the observed values (e.g., training loss, accuracy, activation
    statistics, etc.).

    Attributes:
        observation: Dictionary of observed values.

       The most typical example is a use within links and chains. Suppose that
       a link is registered to the current reporter as an observer (for
       example, the target link of the optimizer is automatically registered to
       the reporter of the :class:`~chainer.training.Trainer`). We can report
       some values from the link as follows::

          class MyRegressor(chainer.Chain):
              def __init__(self, predictor):
                  super(MyRegressor, self).__init__(predictor=predictor)

              def __call__(self, x, y):
                  # This chain just computes the mean absolute and squared
                  # errors between the prediction and y.
                  pred = self.predictor(x)
                  abs_error = F.sum(F.abs(pred - y)) / len(x.data)
                  loss = F.mean_squared_error(pred, y)

                  # Report the mean absolute and squared errors.
                  report({'abs_error': abs_error, 'squared_error': loss}, self)

                  return loss

       If the link is named ``'main'`` in the hierarchy (which is the default
       name of the target link in the
       :class:`~chainer.training.StandardUpdater`), these reported values are
       named ``'main/abs_error'`` and ``'main/squared_error'``. If these values
       are reported inside the :class:`~chainer.training.extension.Evaluator`
       extension, ``'validation/'`` is added at the head of the link name, thus
       the item names are changed to ``'validation/main/abs_error'`` and
       ``'validation/main/squared_error'`` (``'validation'`` is the default
       name of the Evaluator extension).

    Args:
        values (dict): Dictionary of observed values.
        observer: Observer object. Its object ID is used to retrieve the
