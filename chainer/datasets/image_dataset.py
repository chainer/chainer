    """Dataset of images built from a list of paths to image files.

    This dataset reads an external image file on every call of the
    :meth:`__getitem__` operator. The paths to the image to retrieve is given
    as either a list of strings or a text file that contains paths in distinct
    lines.

    Each image is automatically converted to arrays of shape
    ``channels, height, width``, where ``channels`` represents the number of
    channels in each pixel (e.g., 1 for grey-scale images, and 3 for RGB-color
    images).

    .. note::
       **This dataset requires the Pillow package being installed.** In order
       to use this dataset, install Pillow (e.g. by using the command ``pip
       install Pillow``). Be careful to prepare appropriate libraries for image
       formats you want to use (e.g. libpng for PNG images, and libjpeg for JPG
       images).

    .. warning::
       **You are responsible for preprocessing the images before feeding them
       to a model.** For example, if your dataset contains both RGB and
       grayscale images, make sure that you convert them to the same format.
       Otherwise you will get errors because the input dimensions are different
       for RGB and grayscale images.

            file that contains paths to images in distinct lines. If it is a
            list of paths, the ``i``-th element represents the path to the
            ``i``-th image. In both cases, each path is a relative one from the
            root path given by another argument.
