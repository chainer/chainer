class Link(object):

    """Building block of model definitions.

    Link is a building block of neural network models that support various
    features like handling parameters, defining network fragments,
    serialization, etc.

    Link is the primitive structure for the model definitions. It supports
    management of parameter variables and *persistent values* that should be
    incorporated to serialization. Parameters are variables registered via
    the :meth:`add_param` method, or given to the initializer method.
    Persistent values are arrays, scalars, or any other serializable values
    registered via the :meth:`add_persistent` method.

    .. note::
       Whereas arbitrary serializable objects can be registered as persistent
       values, it is strongly recommended to just register values that should
       be treated as results of learning. A typical example of persistent
       values is ones computed during training and required for testing, e.g.
       running statistics for batch normalization.

    Parameters and persistent values are referred by their names. They can be
    accessed as attributes of the links. Link class itself manages the lists
    of names of parameters and persistent values to distinguish parameters and
    persistent values from other attributes.

    Link can be composed into more complex models. This composition feature is
    supported by child classes like :class:`Chain` and :class:`ChainList`. One
    can create a chain by combining one or more links. See the documents for
    these classes for details.

    As noted above, Link supports the serialization protocol of the
    :class:`~chainer.Serializer` class. **Note that only parameters and
    persistent values are saved and loaded.** Other attributes are considered
    as a part of user program (i.e. a part of network definition). In order to
    construct a link from saved file, other attributes must be identically
    reconstructed by user codes.

    .. admonition:: Example

       This is a simple example of custom link definition. Chainer itself also
       provides many links defined under the :mod:`~chainer.links` module. They
       might serve as examples, too.

       Consider we want to define a simple primitive link that implements a
       fully-connected layer based on the :func:`~functions.linear` function.
       Note that this function takes input units, a weight variable, and a bias
       variable as arguments. Then, the fully-connected layer can be defined as
       follows::

          import chainer
          import chainer.functions as F
          import numpy as np

          class LinearLayer(chainer.Link):

              def __init__(self, n_in, n_out):
                  # Parameters are initialized as a numpy array of given shape.
                  super(LinearLayer, self).__init__(
                      W=(n_out, n_in),
                      b=(n_out,),
                  )
                  self.W.data[...] = np.random.randn(n_out, n_in)
                  self.b.data.fill(0)

              def __call__(self, x):
                  return F.linear(x, self.W, self.b)

       This example shows that a user can define arbitrary parameters and use
       them in any methods. Links typically implement the ``__call__``
       operator.

    Args:
        params: Shapes of initial parameters. The keywords are used as their
            names. The names are also set to the parameter variables.

    """Composable link with object-like interface.

    Composability is one of the most important features of neural nets. Neural
    net models consist of many reusable fragments, and each model itself might
    be embedded into a larger learnable system. Chain enables us to write a
    neural net based on composition, without bothering about routine works like
    collecting parameters, serialization, copying the structure with parameters
    shared, etc.

    This class actually provides a way to compose one or more links into one
    structure. A chain can contain one or more *child links*. Child link is a
    link registered to the chain with its own name. The child link is stored to
    an attribute of the chain with the name. User can write a whole model or a
    fragment of neural nets as a child class of Chain.

    Each chain itself is also a link. Therefore, one can combine chains into
    higher-level chains. In this way, links and chains construct a *link
    hierarchy*. Link hierarchy forms a tree structure, where each node is
    identified by the path from the root. The path is represented by a string
    like a file path in UNIX, consisting of names of nodes on the path, joined
    by slashes ``/``.

       hidden layers with rectifiers as activation functions. We can use the

          import chainer
          import chainer.functions as F
          import chainer.links as L

          class MultiLayerPerceptron(chainer.Chain):

              def __init__(self, n_in, n_hidden, n_out):

                      layer1=L.Linear(n_in, n_hidden),
                      layer2=L.Linear(n_hidden, n_hidden),

    child links. The :meth:`add_link` method inserts a new link at the end of
    the list. It is useful to write a chain with arbitrary number of child
    links, e.g. an arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptron.
