    """Discriminative margin-based clustering loss function

    This is the implementation of the following paper:
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02551
    It calculates pixel embeddings, and calculates three different terms
    based on those embeddings and applies them as loss.
    The main idea is that the pixel embeddings
    for same instances have to be closer to each other (pull force),
    for different instances, they have to be further away (push force).
    The loss also brings a weak regularization term to prevent overfitting.
    This loss function calculates the following three parameters:

    Variance Loss
        Loss to penalize distances between pixels which are belonging
        to the same instance. (Pull force)

    Distance loss
        Loss to penalize distances between the centers of instances.
        (Push force)

    Regularization loss
        Small regularization loss to penalize weights against overfitting.
