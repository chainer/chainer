    """BlackOut loss function.

    BlackOut loss function is defined as

    .. math::

      -\\log(p(t)) - \\sum_{s \\in S} \\log(1 - p(s)),

    where :math:`t` is the correct label, :math:`S` is a set of negative
    examples and :math:`p(\\cdot)` is likelihood of a given label.
    And, :math:`p` is defined as

    .. math::

       p(y) = \\frac{\\exp(W_y^\\top x)}{
       \\sum_{s \\in samples} \\exp(W_s^\\top x)}.

    The output is a variable whose value depends on the value of
    the option ``reduce``. If it is ``'no'``, it holds the
    no loss values. If it is ``'mean'``, this function takes
    a mean of loss values.

    Args:
        x (~chainer.Variable): Batch of input vectors.
            Its shape should be :math:`(N, D)`.
        t (~chainer.Variable): Vector of ground truth labels.
            Its shape should be :math:`(N,)`. Each elements :math:`v`
            should satisfy :math:`0 \\geq v \\geq V` or :math:`-1`
            where :math:`V` is the number of label types.
        W (~chainer.Variable): Weight matrix.
            Its shape should be :math:`(V, D)`
        samples (~chainer.Variable): Negative samples.
            Its shape should be :math:`(N, S)` where :math:`S` is
            the number of negative samples.
        reduce (str): Reduction option. Its value must be either
            ``'no'`` or ``'mean'``. Otherwise,
            :class:`ValueError` is raised.

    Returns:
        ~chainer.Variable:
            A variable object holding loss value(s).
            If ``reduce`` is ``'no'``, the output variable holds an
            array whose shape is :math:`(N,)` .
            If it is ``'mean'``, it holds a scalar.
