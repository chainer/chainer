def crf1d(cost, xs, ys, reduce='mean'):
    """Calculates negative log-likelihood of linear-chain CRF.

    It takes a transition cost matrix, a sequence of costs, and a sequence of
    labels. Let :math:`c_{st}` be a transition cost from a label :math:`s` to
    a label :math:`t`, :math:`x_{it}` be a cost of a label :math:`t` at
    position :math:`i`, and :math:`y_i` be an expected label at position
    :math:`i`. The negative log-likelihood of linear-chain CRF is defined as

    .. math::
        L = -\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^l x_{iy_i} + \\
             \\sum_{i=1}^{l-1} c_{y_i y_{i+1}} - {\\log(Z)} \\right) ,

    where :math:`l` is the length of the input sequence and :math:`Z` is the
    normalizing constant called partition function.

    .. note::

       When you want to calculate the negative log-likelihood of sequences
       which have different lengths, sort the sequences in descending order of
       lengths and transpose the sequences.
       For example, you have three input sequences:

       >>> a1 = a2 = a3 = a4 = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, 3).astype('f')
       >>> b1 = b2 = b3 = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, 3).astype('f')
       >>> c1 = c2 = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, 3).astype('f')

       >>> a = [a1, a2, a3, a4]
       >>> b = [b1, b2, b3]
       >>> c = [c1, c2]

       where ``a1`` and all other variables are arrays with ``(K,)`` shape.
       Make a transpose of the sequences:

       >>> x1 = np.stack([a1, b1, c1])
       >>> x2 = np.stack([a2, b2, c2])
       >>> x3 = np.stack([a3, b3])
       >>> x4 = np.stack([a4])

       and make a list of the arrays:

       >>> xs = [x1, x2, x3, x4]

       You need to make label sequences in the same fashion.
       And then, call the function:

       >>> cost = chainer.Variable(
       ...     np.random.uniform(-1, 1, (3, 3)).astype('f'))
       >>> ys = [np.zeros(x.shape[0:1], dtype='i') for x in xs]
       >>> loss = F.crf1d(cost, xs, ys)

       It calculates mean of the negative log-likelihood of the three
       sequences.

       The output is a variable whose value depends on the value of
       the option ``reduce``. If it is ``'no'``, it holds the elementwise
       loss values. If it is ``'mean'``, it holds mean of the loss values.


    Args:
        cost (Variable): A :math:`K \\times K` matrix which holds transition
            cost between two labels, where :math:`K` is the number of labels.
        xs (list of Variable): Input vector for each label.
            ``len(xs)`` denotes the length of the sequence,
            and each :class:`~chainer.Variable` holds a :math:`B \\times K`
            matrix, where :math:`B` is mini-batch size, :math:`K` is the number
            of labels.
            Note that :math:`B`\\ s in all the variables are not necessary
            the same, i.e., it accepts the input sequences with different
            lengths.
        ys (list of Variable): Expected output labels. It needs to have the
            same length as ``xs``. Each :class:`~chainer.Variable` holds a
            :math:`B` integer vector.
            When ``x`` in ``xs`` has the different :math:`B`, correspoding
            ``y`` has the same :math:`B`. In other words, ``ys`` must satisfy
            ``ys[i].shape == xs[i].shape[0:1]`` for all ``i``.
        reduce (str): Reduction option. Its value must be either
            ``'mean'`` or ``'no'``. Otherwise, :class:`ValueError` is raised.

    Returns:
        ~chainer.Variable: A variable holding the average negative
        log-likelihood of the input sequences.
