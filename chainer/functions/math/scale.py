def scale(x, y, axis=1):
    """Elementwise product with broadcasting.

    Computes a elementwise product of two input variables, with the shape of
    the latter variable broadcasted to match the shape of the former. ``axis``
    is the first axis of the first variable along which the second variable is
    applied.

    The term "broadcasting" here comes from Caffe's scale layer so the
    "broadcasting" with the following arguments::

           x : 100 x 3 x 40 x 5 x 6
           y : 3 x 40
        axis : 1

    is equivalent to the following numpy broadcasting::

        x : 100 x  3 x 40 x 5 x 6
        y :  (1 x) 3 x 40 x 1 x 1

    Note that the axis of ``x`` to which we apply ``y`` is specified by the
    argument ``axis``, whose meaning is different from numpy's ``axis``.

    Args:
        x (~chainer.Variable): Input variable to be scaled.
        y (~chainer.Variable): Input variable to scale, broadcasted.
        axis (int): The first axis of ``x`` along which ``y`` is applied.

    Returns:
        ~chainer.Variable: Output variable.
