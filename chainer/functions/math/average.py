    """Calculate weighted average of array elements over a given axis.

    Args:
        x (~chainer.Variable): Elements to sum.
        axis (None or int or tuple of int): Axis which the method is performed.
            With the default (axis = None) it performs a mean over all the
            dimensions of the input array.
        weights (None or chainer.Variable): An array holding weights to
            calculate weighted average. If it is ``None``, all weights are
            assumed to be one.
            When ``axis`` is ``None``, ``weights`` must have the same shape
            of ``x``. And when ``axis`` is ``int``, it must be 1-D array
            satisfing ``weights.shape == (x.shape[axis],)``.
        keepdims (bool): If ``True``, the specified axes are remained as axes
            of length one.

    Returns:
        ~chainer.Variable: Output variable.
