    Stacked Uni-directional Gated Recurrent Unit function.

    This function calculates stacked Uni-directional GRU with sequences.
    This function gets an initial hidden state :math:`h_0`, an input
    sequence :math:`x`, weight matrices :math:`W`, and bias vectors :math:`b`.
    This function calculates hidden states :math:`h_t` for each time :math:`t`
    from input :math:`x_t`.

    .. math::
       r_t &= \\sigma(W_0 x_t + W_3 h_{t-1} + b_0 + b_3) \\\\
       z_t &= \\sigma(W_1 x_t + W_4 h_{t-1} + b_1 + b_4) \\\\
       h'_t &= \\tanh(W_2 x_t + b_2 + r_t \\cdot (W_5 h_{t-1} + b_5)) \\\\
       h_t &= (1 - z_t) \\cdot h'_t + z_t \\cdot h_{t-1}

    As the function accepts a sequence, it calculates :math:`h_t` for all
    :math:`t` with one call. Six weight matrices and six bias vectors are
    required for each layers. So, when :math:`S` layers exists, you need to
    prepare :math:`6S` weigth matrices and :math:`6S` bias vectors.

    If the number of layers ``n_layers`` is greather than :math:`1`, input
    of ``k``-th layer is hidden state ``h_t`` of ``k-1``-th layer.
    Note that all input variables except first layer may have different shape
    from the first layer.

       ``train`` and ``use_cudnn`` arguments are not supported anymore since
       v2.

            Only ``ws[0][j]`` where ``0 <= j < 3`` is ``(I, N)`` shape as they
            are multiplied with input variables. All other matrices has
            ``(N, N)`` shape.
        bs (list of list of chainer.Variable): Bias vectors. ``bs[i]``
            represnents biases for i-th layer.
            Each ``bs[i]`` is a list containing six vectors.
            ``bs[i][j]`` is corresponding with ``b_j`` in the equation.

            mini-batch size for time ``t``, and ``I`` is size of input units.
            Note that this function supports variable length sequences.
            When sequneces has different lengths, sort sequences in descending
            order by length, and transpose the sorted sequence.
            :func:`~chainer.functions.transpose_sequence` transpose a list
            of :func:`~chainer.Variable` holding sequence.
            So ``xs`` needs to satisfy

    Returns:
        tuple: This function returns a tuple containing three elements,
