    Stacked Uni-directional Long Short-Term Memory function.

    This function calculates stacked Uni-directional LSTM with sequences.
    This function gets an initial hidden state :math:`h_0`, an initial cell
    state :math:`c_0`, an input sequence :math:`x`, weight matrices :math:`W`,
    and bias vectors :math:`b`.
    This function calculates hidden states :math:`h_t` and :math:`c_t` for each
    time :math:`t` from input :math:`x_t`.

    .. math::
       i_t &= \\sigma(W_0 x_t + W_4 h_{t-1} + b_0 + b_4) \\\\
       f_t &= \\sigma(W_1 x_t + W_5 h_{t-1} + b_1 + b_5) \\\\
       o_t &= \\sigma(W_2 x_t + W_6 h_{t-1} + b_2 + b_6) \\\\
       a_t &= \\tanh(W_3 x_t + W_7 h_{t-1} + b_3 + b_7) \\\\
       c_t &= f_t \\cdot c_{t-1} + i_t \\cdot a_t \\\\
       h_t &= o_t \\cdot \\tanh(c_t)

    As the function accepts a sequence, it calculates :math:`h_t` for all
    :math:`t` with one call. Eight weight matrices and eight bias vectors are
    required for each layer. So, when :math:`S` layers exist, you need to
    prepare :math:`8S` weigth matrices and :math:`8S` bias vectors.

    If the number of layers ``n_layers`` is greater than :math:`1`, the input
    of the ``k``-th layer is the hidden state ``h_t`` of the ``k-1``-th layer.
    Note that all input variables except the first layer may have different
    shape from the first layer.

    .. warning::

       ``train`` and ``use_cudnn`` arguments are not supported anymore since
       v2.
       Instead, use ``chainer.using_config('train', train)`` and
       ``chainer.using_config('use_cudnn', use_cudnn)`` respectively.
       See :func:`chainer.using_config`.

    Args:
        n_layers(int): The number of layers.
        dropout_ratio(float): Dropout ratio.
        hx (~chainer.Variable): Variable holding stacked hidden states.
            Its shape is ``(S, B, N)`` where ``S`` is the number of layers and
            is equal to ``n_layers``, ``B`` is the mini-batch size, and ``N``
            is the dimension of the hidden units.
        cx (~chainer.Variable): Variable holding stacked cell states.
            It has the same shape as ``hx``.
        ws (list of list of :class:`~chainer.Variable`): Weight matrices.
            ``ws[i]`` represents the weights for the i-th layer.
            Each ``ws[i]`` is a list containing eight matrices.
            ``ws[i][j]`` corresponds to :math:`W_j` in the equation.
            Only ``ws[0][j]`` where ``0 <= j < 4`` are ``(I, N)``-shaped as
            they are multiplied with input variables, where ``I`` is the size
            of the input and ``N`` is the dimension of the hidden units. All
            other matrices are ``(N, N)``-shaped.
        bs (list of list of :class:`~chainer.Variable`): Bias vectors.
            ``bs[i]`` represents the biases for the i-th layer.
            Each ``bs[i]`` is a list containing eight vectors.
            ``bs[i][j]`` corresponds to :math:`b_j` in the equation.
            The shape of each matrix is ``(N,)`` where ``N`` is the dimension
            of the hidden units.
        xs (list of :class:`~chainer.Variable`):
            A list of :class:`~chainer.Variable`
            holding input values. Each element ``xs[t]`` holds input value
            for time ``t``. Its shape is ``(B_t, I)``, where ``B_t`` is the
            mini-batch size for time ``t``. The sequences must be transposed.
            :func:`~chainer.functions.transpose_sequence` can be used to
            transpose a list of :class:`~chainer.Variable`\\ s each
            representing a sequence.
            When sequences has different lengths, they must be
            sorted in descending order of their lengths before transposing.
            So ``xs`` needs to satisfy
            ``xs[t].shape[0] >= xs[t + 1].shape[0]``.

    Returns:
        tuple: This function returns a tuple containing three elements,
        ``hy``, ``cy`` and ``ys``.

        - ``hy`` is an updated hidden states whose shape is the same as
          ``hx``.
        - ``cy`` is an updated cell states whose shape is the same as
          ``cx``.
        - ``ys`` is a list of :class:`~chainer.Variable` . Each element
          ``ys[t]`` holds hidden states of the last layer corresponding
          to an input ``xs[t]``. Its shape is ``(B_t, N)`` where ``B_t`` is
          the mini-batch size for time ``t``, and ``N`` is size of hidden
          units. Note that ``B_t`` is the same value as ``xs[t]``.

    .. note::

       The dimension of hidden units is limited to only one size ``N``. If you
       want to use variable dimension of hidden units, please use
       :class:`chainer.functions.lstm`.

        ``hy``, ``cy`` and ``ys``.

            - ``hy`` is an updated hidden states whose shape is the same as
              ``hx``.
            - ``cy`` is an updated cell states whose shape is the same as
              ``cx``.
            - ``ys`` is a list of :class:`~chainer.Variable` . Each element
              ``ys[t]`` holds hidden states of the last layer corresponding
              to an input ``xs[t]``. Its shape is ``(B_t, N)`` where ``B_t`` is
              the mini-batch size for time ``t``. Note that ``B_t`` is the same
              value as ``xs[t]``.
