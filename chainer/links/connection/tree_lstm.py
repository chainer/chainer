    .. warning::

        This feature is experimental. The interface can change in the future.

    This is a Child-Sum TreeLSTM unit as a chain.
    This link is a variable arguments function, which compounds
    the states of all children nodes into the new states of
    a current (parent) node. *states* denotes the cell state, :math:`c`,
    and the output, :math:`h`, which are produced by this link.
    This link doesn't keep cell and hidden states internally.

    For example, this link is called such as
    ``func(c1, c2, h1, h2, x)`` if the number of children nodes is 2,
    while ``func(c1, c2, c3, h1, h2, h3, x)`` if that is 3.
    This function is *independent* from an order of children nodes.
    Thus, the returns of ``func(c1, c2, h1, h2, x)`` equal to
    those of ``func(c2, c1, h2, h1, x)``.

    Args:
        in_size (int): Dimension of input vectors.
        out_size (int): Dimensionality of cell and output vectors.

    Attributes:
        W_x (chainer.links.Linear): Linear layer of
            connections from input vectors.
        W_h_aio (chainer.links.Linear): Linear layer of connections between
            (:math:`a`, :math:`i`, :math:`o`) and summation of children's
            output vectors. :math:`a`, :math:`i` and :math:`o` denotes
            input compound,
            input gate and output gate, respectively.
            :math:`a`, input compound, equals to :math:`u` in
            the paper by Tai et al.
        W_h_f (chainer.links.Linear): Linear layer of connections between
            forget gate :math:`f` and the output of each child.

    Tai et al.'s N-Ary TreeLSTM is little extended in

    Specifically, eq. 10 in Tai et al. has only one :math:`W` matrix
    to be applied to :math:`x`, consistently for all children.
    On the other hand, Bowman et al.'s model has multiple matrices,
    each of which affects the forget gate for each child's cell individually.
