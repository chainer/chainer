    """Two-dimensional MLP convolution layer of Network in Network.

    This is an "mlpconv" layer from the Network in Network paper. This layer
    is a two-dimensional convolution layer followed by 1x1 convolution layers
    and interleaved activation functions.

    Note that it does not apply the activation function to the output of the
    last 1x1 convolution layer.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels of input arrays.
        out_channels (tuple of ints): Tuple of number of channels. The i-th
            integer indicates the number of filters of the i-th convolution.
        ksize (int or pair of ints): Size of filters (a.k.a. kernels) of the
            first convolution layer. ``ksize=k`` and ``ksize=(k, k)`` are
            equivalent.
        stride (int or pair of ints): Stride of filter applications at the
            first convolution layer. ``stride=s`` and ``stride=(s, s)`` are
            equivalent.
        pad (int or pair of ints): Spatial padding width for input arrays at
            the first convolution layer. ``pad=p`` and ``pad=(p, p)`` are
            equivalent.
        activation (function): Activation function for internal hidden units.
            Note that this function is not applied to the output of this link.
        use_cudnn (bool): If ``True``, then this link uses cuDNN if available.
        conv_init: An initializer of weight matrices
            passed to the convolution layers.
        bias_init: An initializer of bias vectors
            passed to the convolution layers.

    See: `Network in Network <http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4400v3>`.

    Attributes:
        activation (function): Activation function.
