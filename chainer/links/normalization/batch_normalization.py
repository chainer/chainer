class BatchNormalization(link.Link):

    """Batch normalization layer on outputs of linear or convolution functions.

    This link wraps the :func:`~chainer.functions.batch_normalization` and
    :func:`~chainer.functions.fixed_batch_normalization` functions.

    It runs in three modes: training mode, fine-tuning mode, and testing mode.

    In training mode, it normalizes the input by *batch statistics*. It also
    maintains approximated population statistics by moving averages, which can
    be used for instant evaluation in testing mode.

    In fine-tuning mode, it accumulates the input to compute *population
    statistics*. In order to correctly compute the population statistics, a
    user must use this mode to feed mini-batches running through whole training
    dataset.

    In testing mode, it uses pre-computed population statistics to normalize
    the input variable. The population statistics is approximated if it is
    computed by training mode, or accurate if it is correctly computed by
    fine-tuning mode.

    Args:
        size (int or tuple of ints): Size (or shape) of channel
            dimensions.
        decay (float): Decay rate of moving average. It is used on training.
        eps (float): Epsilon value for numerical stability.
        dtype (numpy.dtype): Type to use in computing.
        use_gamma (bool): If ``True``, use scaling parameter. Otherwise, use
            unit(1) which makes no effect.
        use_beta (bool): If ``True``, use shifting parameter. Otherwise, use
            unit(0) which makes no effect.

          Internal Covariate Shift <https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167>`_

    Attributes:
        gamma (~chainer.Variable): Scaling parameter.
        beta (~chainer.Variable): Shifting parameter.
        avg_mean (numpy.ndarray or cupy.ndarray): Population mean.
        avg_var (numpy.ndarray or cupy.ndarray): Population variance.
        N (int): Count of batches given for fine-tuning.
        decay (float): Decay rate of moving average. It is used on training.
        ~BatchNormalization.eps (float): Epsilon value for numerical stability.
            This value is added to the batch variances.
        axis (int or tuple of int): Axis over which normalization is
            performed. When axis is ``None``, it is determined from input
            dimensions. For example, if ``x.ndim`` is 4, axis becomes (0, 2, 3)
            and normalization is performed over 0th, 2nd and 3rd axis of input.
            If it is 2, axis becomes (0) and normalization is performed
            over 0th axis of input. When a tuple of int is given to this
            option, numbers in the tuple must be being sorted in ascending
            order. For example, (0, 2) is OK, but (2, 0) is not.
