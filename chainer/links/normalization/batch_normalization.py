class BatchNormalization(link.Link):

    """Batch normalization layer on outputs of linear or convolution functions.

    This link wraps the :func:`~chainer.functions.batch_normalization` and
    :func:`~chainer.functions.fixed_batch_normalization` functions.

    It runs in three modes: training mode, fine-tuning mode, and testing mode.

    In training mode, it normalizes the input by *batch statistics*. It also
    maintains approximated population statistics by moving averages, which can
    be used for instant evaluation in testing mode.

    In fine-tuning mode, it accumulates the input to compute *population
    statistics*. In order to correctly compute the population statistics, a
    user must use this mode to feed mini batches running through whole training
    dataset.

    In testing mode, it uses pre-computed population statistics to normalize
    the input variable. The population statistics is approximated if it is
    computed by training mode, or accurate if it is correctly computed by
    fine-tuning mode.

    Args:
        size (int or tuple of ints): Size (or shape) of channel
            dimensions.
        decay (float): Decay rate of moving average. It is used on training.
        eps (float): Epsilon value for numerical stability.
        dtype (numpy.dtype): Type to use in computing.

          Internal Covariate Shift <http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167>`_

    Attributes:
        gamma (~chainer.Variable): Scaling parameter.
        beta (~chainer.Variable): Shifting parameter.
        avg_mean (~chainer.Variable): Population mean.
        avg_var (~chainer.Variable): Population variance.
        N (int): Count of batches given for fine-tuning.
        decay (float): Decay rate of moving average. It is used on training.
        eps (float): Epsilon value for numerical stability. This value is added
            to the batch variances.
