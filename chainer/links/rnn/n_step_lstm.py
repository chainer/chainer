                Initial hidden states. If ``None`` is specified zero-vector
                is used. Its shape is ``(S, B, N)`` for uni-directional LSTM

                the number of layers and is equal to ``n_layers``,
                ``B`` is the mini-batch size,
                and ``N`` is the dimension of the hidden units.

                Initial cell states. If ``None`` is specified zero-vector is
                used.  It has the same shape as ``hx``.
            xs (list of :class:`~chainer.Variable`): List of input sequences.
                Each element ``xs[i]`` is a :class:`chainer.Variable` holding
                a sequence. Its shape is ``(L_i, I)``, where ``L_i`` is the
                length of a sequence for batch ``i``, and ``I`` is the size of
                the input and is equal to ``in_size``.

              ``hx``.
            - ``cy`` is an updated cell states whose shape is the same as
              ``cx``.
            - ``ys`` is a list of :class:`~chainer.Variable` . Each element
              ``ys[i]`` holds hidden states of the last layer corresponding
              to an input ``xs[i]``. Its shape is ``(L_i, N)`` for
              uni-directional LSTM and ``(L_i, 2N)`` for bi-directional LSTM
              where ``L_i`` is the length of a sequence for batch ``i``,
